A simple bot for Discord that announces your Twitch stream

## What does it do?
When you turn your Twitch stream, `pil-bot` will notify in your discord channel with a link to your stream, the game you are playing, and the current number of viewers.
The information is updated every minute to provide your followers up to date information on your stream.

## How do I set it up?
Check out the code and run it wherever you would like! A hosting solutions like Heroku is great for this (`Procfile` is ready for you).
To run, you need to pass a few environment variables, then run `npm start`.

```shell
$ export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN='MyDiscordBot'
$ export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID='MyTwitchClientId'
$ export TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET='MyTwitchClientSecret'
$ export STREAMERS='{"MyStreamerId":"MyDiscordChannelId"}'
$ npm start
> pil-bot@0.1.1 start /Users/phan/projects/pil-bot
> node src/clock.js
```

In Discord, you want to provide following permissions for your bot. At the end, you should use `224256` as your permission value.
* Read Messages
* Embed Links
* Read Message History
* Send Messages
* Manage Messages
* Mention @everyone
* View Channel
